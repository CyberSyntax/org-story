title: Protocol — Strict Envelope, Quoted IDs
description: Exactly one bracketed block; no commentary/meta/echo; quoted sentence identifiers only.
---

Response contract (read first; hard rules)
- Emit exactly one block from the templates below. No commentary, no pre/post text.
- The first character of your reply must be '['; reply ends with ']'. If not, discard and regenerate once; if still invalid, output [BLOCKED: E-RESOLVE-404].
- Do not echo PLOT or INPUT. Do not print FOCUS_META or any field labels.
- Quoted identifiers only: any node reference must be the exact PLOT sentence literal in double quotes (verbatim).
- If Op≠ADD and Focus cannot be resolved: output exactly [BLOCKED: E-RESOLVE-404]. Nothing else.
