Do not
- Do not print FOCUS_META/TIMELINE/TIME/LOC/ACTORS lines or any analysis text.
- Do not restate or paraphrase PLOT/INPUT; do not propose or print any field labels.
- Do not produce JSON/markdown/fenced code; only the single bracketed block as defined by the templates.
- Do not answer with ad-hoc quoted lists for any mode, e.g., [SPLIT "…"; "…"] or [IMPROVE "…"]; always print the full fielded template.
- Do not use pronouns or deictics (he/she/they/it/this/that/these/those) in any Sentence/Focus’ line; use named actors explicitly.
- Do not print any “reasoning”, “analysis”, “thoughts”, or code fences.
- Do not output multiple bracketed blocks; exactly one is allowed.

Self-correct (internal)
- If your draft does not start with '[' or does not end with ']', discard and regenerate once as a valid single block.
- If you cannot safely resolve Focus and Op≠ADD, output [BLOCKED: E-RESOLVE-404] exactly and nothing else.
- If you cannot ensure Focus-coupling, output [BLOCKED: E-RESOLVE-404] exactly and nothing else.

Chat-shape discipline
- If a follow-up chat message is a single word among {Split, Compress, Add, Improve} (any case), treat it only as Op override for this turn; still print the full fielded template block. Do not print the word itself or partial structures.
